# Universal Token Credit System

A mathematical credit system designed to incentivize care labor without creating domination. Credits flow to those who help others, with branch-based quorum approval for spending and automatic escalation to ensure "all are responsible for all."

## üéØ Core Principles

- **Equal baseline worth**: No wealth multipliers or stake advantages
- **Non-transferable credits**: Cannot be traded or sold (soulbound to humans)
- **Care labor incentives**: Rewards support, mediation, repair work, community organization
- **Branch quorum approval**: Collective approval required for spending credits
- **Cross-branch escalation**: Issues that can't be resolved locally automatically escalate
- **Anti-domination safeguards**: Built-in protections against abuse and accumulation

## üßÆ Mathematical Model

### Credit Award Formula

When someone helps others, they earn credits based on:

```
ŒîCR_h = w_a √ó k √ó œÅ √ó (Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó C(h,S)) √ó œÉ(Œ∏ - CRÃÑ_B(h))
```

Where:
- `w_a`: Base award for action type (e.g., 3 for support, 8 for mediation)
- `k`: Evidence confidence (0-1, how verifiable the help was)
- `œÅ`: Diversity factor (higher when helping diverse groups)
- `C(h,S)`: Connectedness between helper and helped people (0-1)
- `Œ≤‚ÇÄ, Œ≤‚ÇÅ`: Connection weighting (0.6, 0.4 default)
- `œÉ(Œ∏ - CRÃÑ_B)`: Sigmoid scarcity bonus when branch needs credits

### Branch Quorum Requirements

To spend credits, your branch must approve via:
- **Participation**: ‚â•40% of members vote
- **Path diversity**: ‚â•3 different social paths represented  
- **Approval threshold**: Trimmed mean ‚â•0.6 (60% approval)

### Cross-Branch Escalation

Issues escalate when local branch capacity is exceeded:

```
E(B‚ÇÄ,X) = Œ≥‚ÇÅ√óI_B‚ÇÄ(X) + Œ≥‚ÇÇ√ó(OpenNeeds/|B|) + Œ≥‚ÇÉ√ó(1-œÅ_B‚ÇÄ)
```

Triggers when E > 0.4 (threshold), automatically finding neighbor branches to help.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createCreditClient } from './client/credit_sdk.js';

const client = createCreditClient({
  private_key: 'your_ed25519_key',
  public_key: 'your_public_key', 
  her_cid: 'your_human_existence_record_cid'
});

// Earn credits for helping someone
await client.helpedSomeone({
  person_helped: 'friend_her_cid',
  help_type: 'technical',
  description: 'Helped debug their website',
  quality_rating: 4
});

// Check your balance
const balance = await client.getBalance();
console.log(`Balance: ${balance.balance?.balance} credits`);
```

### 2. Organizing Events

```typescript
// Earn credits for organizing community events
await client.organizedEvent({
  event_type: 'workshop',
  participants: ['person1_cid', 'person2_cid', 'person3_cid'],
  duration_hours: 2,
  description: 'Web development workshop for beginners'
});
```

### 3. Branch Spending (Requires Approval)

```typescript
// Request to spend credits (needs branch votes first)
await client.spendCredits({
  amount: 10,
  purpose: 'Fund technical support for community members',
  spend_type: 'local',
  branch_votes: [
    { voter: 'member1_cid', vote: 0.8, signature: 'sig1' },
    { voter: 'member2_cid', vote: 0.7, signature: 'sig2' },
    // ... more votes to reach quorum
  ]
});
```

## üîó Integration with Social Safety System

The credit system automatically integrates with existing social components:

```typescript
import { triggerCreditIntegration } from './integrations/safety_system_hooks.js';

// When someone resolves an issue, they automatically earn credits
const result = await triggerCreditIntegration('issue.resolved', {
  issue_id: 'issue_123',
  helpers: ['helper1_cid', 'helper2_cid'],
  resolution_type: 'mediation',
  subject_set: ['affected_person_cid']
});
```

### Automatic Credit Events

| Social Action | Credit Award | Integration Point |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Resolve support issue | 3-12 credits | `issue.resolved` |
| Provide emotional support | 4 credits | `support.provided` |
| Organize community meeting | 4-8 credits | `meeting.completed` |
| Mediate conflict | 8 credits | `issue.resolved` (mediation) |
| Participate in voting | 1 credit | `voting.participation` |

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Abuse Safeguards

- **Evidence requirements**: All credit awards need confidence scores and witnesses
- **Branch quorum**: No individual can spend credits alone
- **Path diversity**: Prevents voting cliques from dominating approvals  
- **Budget caps**: Per-human (100 credits) and per-epoch system limits
- **Decay mechanism**: Credits slowly decay to prevent hoarding
- **Appeal system**: Disputed actions can be escalated for review

## ‚öôÔ∏è Default Parameters

Key system parameters (configurable):

```json
{
  "C_max": 100,          // Max credits per person
  "I_max": 10000,        // Max credits issued per epoch  
  "alpha": 0.4,          // Min participation rate for quorum
  "q": 3,                // Min path diversity
  "tau": 0.6,            // Approval threshold
  "delta": 0.98,         // Credit decay rate
  "Theta_esc": 0.4,      // Escalation trigger threshold
  "c_local": 2,          // Cost for local help
  "c_xbranch": 5,        // Cost for cross-branch help
  "c_global": 10         // Cost for global escalation
}
```
